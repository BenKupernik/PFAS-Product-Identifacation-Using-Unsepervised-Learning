This project is the final project for my unsupervised learning course from the University of Colorado Boulder. The idea behind this project is to see if I can use unsupervised learning methods such as Multi-Dimensional Analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering to identify patterns in PFAS data. I achieved limited success using MDA to transform relevant data into what I think of as product space and using K-Means clustering to identify three groups. Further investigation could include identifying end members using cosine similarity and linear independence, and applying a linear mixing model as referenced in the paper below to determine composition of the groups.
